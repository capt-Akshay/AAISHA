# AI Mental Health Therapist Bot

## Introduction
This project aims to create an AI-powered mental health therapist bot that can provide affordable and accessible mental health support to individuals in need. The bot is based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms, allowing it to understand and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Flask

## Current Status
This project is in its preliminary stages, with the initial version of the bot able to address a limited set of mental health concerns. The bot is being continuously updated with more advanced intents and machine learning algorithms to enhance its capabilities and expand its scope.

## Future Plans
1. Deploying the bot on the internet to make it more easily accessible to users.
2. Adding an authentication system to ensure user safety and privacy.
3. Integrating the bot with speech recognition technology to enable users to communicate with it via voice commands.
4. Adding support for multiple languages to enable the bot to reach a wider audience globally.

We are committed to improving the accuracy and effectiveness of our AI mental health therapist bot, and our ultimate goal is to provide affordable and accessible mental health support to individuals in need, contributing to the overall well-being of our society.
